      <p>The UX Clinic consulting and free case study report was worth at least $15,000 USD for my company. It was such a blessing to have sureify.com selected. Our company was so fortunate to receive 100+ of hours of work and a detailed report on our current UI/UX.</p>

      <p>It is very easy to get too used to your own UX and UI. You start making bad decisions based on your own feelings. Working with the UX Clinic was extremely useful to get objective feedback on our product.</p>

    <p>Through our interviews with potential users, we gathered their first impressions using Skedio. We found out that although the app has a great precision and performance, users felt overwhelmed with the amount of buttons. They thought the app was outdated and they were intimidated by the complex examples</p>

    <img src="http://theuxclinic.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ux-case-study-7geese.jpg" />
    <p>We decided to investigate if the 1-on-1 process in 7Geese reflects the needs of managers and the expectations from employees.We took a divergent approach by asking participants to embody their mental models regarding 1-on-1 meetings as a way for team members to express issues, ideas, and frustrations that might not fit into other organizational mechanisms through the construction of their ideal 1-on-1 process. </p>
